Action RPG Open-World Game (Unreal Engine 5 – C++):

This repository contains an Action RPG–style open-world game developed in Unreal Engine 5 using C++.
The project was built from an empty level and focuses on creating a playable third-person combat experience within a large, explorable environment.

The game emphasizes core gameplay programming, combat mechanics, enemy behavior, and environment creation, using Unreal Engine 5’s modern systems and workflows.


Project Summary:
The player explores an open world, engages in melee combat with various enemies, and progresses by defeating opponents and collecting rewards.
The project demonstrates the integration of character control, combat logic, enemy AI, animation-driven gameplay, and basic progression elements.

Gameplay systems are designed to be reusable and extensible, allowing multiple enemy types and interactions to share common behavior while still feeling distinct.


Development Focus:
-This project showcases practical experience with:
-Unreal Engine 5 gameplay programming in C++
-Third-person character movement and combat
-Enemy behavior and AI logic
-Animation-driven interactions
-Open-world level creation and environment setup
-Core game development math and engine fundamentals


Learning & Implementation Goals:
-The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with:
-Building gameplay systems from scratch
-Structuring Unreal Engine C++ classes effectively
-Combining code, animation, and assets into a cohesive game experience
-Using Unreal Engine 5’s updated tools and workflows in a real project


Project Scope:
-This is a single-player action RPG prototype intended as:
-A technical learning project
-A portfolio demonstration of Unreal Engine 5 C++ development
-A foundation for future expansion or experimentation
